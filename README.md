# 🥊 One-on-One Fighter

One-on-One Fighter is a simple, turn-based browser game where players face off against a computer opponent in a battle of strategy and luck. Originally created in December 2019, this game serves as a snapshot of early web development practices.

This project was developed in December 2019 and reflects the web development practices and standards of that time. It has been updated to ensure compatibility with modern web standards and practices.

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 Turn-based combat system
- 🧠 Player vs. Computer gameplay
- 📊 Dynamic stats: Strength, Cunning, Speed, and Fatigue
- 🎮 Three action types: Attack, Defend, and Finishing Move
- 🖥️ Simple, classic browser game design

## 🎮 How to Play

1. 🌐 Open `index.html` in a web browser to start the game.
2. 🎲 Your character's stats and the computer's stats are randomly generated at the start of each game.
3. 🤔 Choose your action each turn:
   - ⚔️ Attack: Attempt to damage your opponent
   - 🛡️ Defend: Increase your defense for the next turn
   - 💥 Finishing Move: A powerful attack available only when your fatigue is twice that of your opponent
4. 🤖 The computer will choose its action after your turn.
5. 😓 Keep an eye on your fatigue level - if it reaches zero, you lose!
6. 🏁 The game continues until one fighter's fatigue reaches zero or a finishing move is successfully executed.

## 🧩 Game Mechanics

- 💪 Strength, Cunning, and Speed influence your attack and defense capabilities.
- 📉 Fatigue decreases as you take damage. If your fatigue reaches zero, you lose the game.
- 📊 Your stats decrease slightly for every 5 points of fatigue lost.
- 🌟 The Finishing Move becomes available when your fatigue is more than double your opponent's.
